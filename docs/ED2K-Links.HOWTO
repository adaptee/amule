 Konqueror
-----------

  1. /usr/kde/3.1/share/services
  You can find it by file names ended with .protocol
  Somethign like `find /usr -name "*.protocol"` or `find /opt -name "*.protocol"`
  or even put / to path if you want.

  2. If the first was successful, create a file named something like e2k.protocol in
  the mentioned directory:

  [Protocol]
  exec=/usr/local/bin/ed2k "%u"
  protocol=ed2k
  input=none
  output=none
  helper=true
  listing=false
  reading=false
  writing=false
  makedir=false
  deleting=false

  3. Reload konqueror

 Opera
-------

  * Opera 6.11

    First of all: Opera 6.11 doesn't pass complete URL to external programs - only URL
    without protocol. don't know wheather this behaviour has changed in later releases.

    Create amule_submit.sh with this content:

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/local/bin/ed2k "ed2k://$1";

    Now edit (as root) /etc/opera6rc or as non-root ~/.opera/opera6.ini:

    [Trusted Applications]
    ed2k=/usr/local/bin/amule_submit.sh

    [User Prefs]
    TrustedExternalURLProtocols=ed2k

  * Opera 7.1 (slightly different from Opera 6)

    Edit either /etc/opera6rc or ~/.opera/opera6.ini and add the following:

    In [User Prefs]
    TrustedExternalURLProtocols=ed2k

    In [Trusted Applications]
    ed2k=/path/to/ed2k ed2k://%u

 Mozilla 1.3+ / FireFox 0.6+
-----------------------------

  1. Go to http://mozex.mozdev.org/installation.html and click the
  install link. This will automatically install Mozex plugin for
  your browser.

  2. Restart your browser.

  3a. Firefox:  Go to Tools->Preferences->Extensions->Mozex->Options
  and add 'ed2k %r' in the ED2K box.

  3b. Mozilla: Go to Edit->Preferences->Mozex and add 'ed2k %r' in
  the ED2K box.

 Mozilla before v1.3 / Firefox before v0.6
-------------------------------------------

  1) Go to http://protozilla.mozdev.org/download.html
  Choose the version fitting your mozilla-version and click
  on "install". It will auto-install protozilla.
  Now close mozilla completely.

  Notes:
  - You must have write permission to the mozilla-installation-directory
    for this. If you've installed mozilla to /usr , you'll have to be
    root probably.
  - The downloadable precompiled version of protozilla apparently does
    _not_ work with debian mozilla packages. It _does_ work together
    with the precompiled version of 1.2.1 available at mozilla.org for
    example (or you can build both mozilla and protozilla yourself)

  2) This step is only necessary if you had to start mozilla as root in
  step 1). If you did step 1) with the same user as you normally use,
  you can skip it

  As root do:
  cp -r /root/.mozilla/PROFILENAME/RANDOM.slt/protozilla/
  /home/USERNAME/.mozilla/PROFILENAME2/RANDOM.slt/"

  Copy protozilla-configuration from root's home to user's home.

  cd /home/USERNAME/.mozilla/PROFILENAME/RANDOM.slt/
  chown -R YOURUSER.YOURGROUP protozilla"

  cd to user's mozilla config-dir and change file-ownership parameters.

  Note:
  USERNAME: name of your normal, non-root user
  PROFILENAME: name of the profile you'll want to use
  RANDOM: random alphanumeric string, autogenerated by mozilla
  YOURUSER, YOURGROUP: user and group of your normal user

  3) Setup a protocol-handler for ed2k-links:

  cd to ~/.mozilla/PROFILENAME/RANDOM.slt/protozilla/protocol

  Create a file called "ed2k.cmd" with the following content:

  ed2k ed2k:$URI_DATA

  Do this with your favorite text-editor, the file doesn't have to be executable

  Now restart mozilla, and everything should work.
